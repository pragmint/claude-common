# Plan

Create a detailed plan document that outlines the problem, solution approach, and technical implementation steps.

## Steps

* Understand the problem
  * Analyze the user's request or requirements
  * Research the current codebase to understand existing patterns
  * Identify constraints and dependencies
* Document the problem
  * Write a clear problem statement
  * Define success criteria
  * Note any assumptions or constraints
* Design the solution
  * Propose a high-level solution approach
  * Consider alternative approaches and trade-offs
  * Identify the components that need to be created or modified
* Create technical plan
  * Break down the solution into specific implementation steps
  * Identify the files and functions that need changes
  * Plan the order of implementation (tests first, then implementation)
  * Consider integration points and potential risks
* Write the plan document
  * Save the plan as `PLAN.md` in the .claude/planning/ directory
  * Include problem statement, solution approach, and detailed steps
  * Make the plan actionable for other agents to follow
